Description:
============
This program illustrates how to use NPL's 'bus' construct and provides sandbox for experimenting.

'bus' program does following:
  * Defines 'packet_field_bus' which holds source,destination IP addresses of packet.
  * Parses incoming packet.
  * Populates 'packet_field_bus' based on incoming packets IP header.
  * Prints contents of 'packet_field_bus' on BM console.

Contents:
=========
bus
|-- npl
|   |-- bus.npl           (main program code)
|   |-- base_helper.npl   (support code that is needed for program to compile & execute)
|-- config.ini            (configuration file that can be used as-is)
|-- Makefile              
|-- bm_tests              (Scripts to support topology, packet crafting, packet send & receive)
    |-- corp_net
    |   |-- testPkt.py
    |-- sf_definition     (Special Function definition to interact with BMI* code)
        |-- bm_sfc.cpp


Compile & Run the program:
==========================
To compile 'bus' program, run following commands from program directory:
   * make fe_nplsim
   * make nplsim_comp
At this point, all files needed to run NPL Behavior Model (BM) are generated.
There are two options to run 'bus' program with NPL BM.
   1. If xterm is supported, just run: 
      *   make nplsim_run    (this is simple and easy way to run)
   2. If xterm is NOT supported then:  (manually running BM components)
      2a. Open two terminal windows and browse to 'bus' program directory.
      2b. Terminal-1: Run 'bus' program's Behavior Model:
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> ./fe_output/bmodel/bin/bmodel.sim
      2c. Terminal-2: Run Behavior Model CLI program.
          :> source ./ncsc-x.x.x/bin/setup.sh
          cd <npl_example>  
          :> python $BRCM_NCS_ROOT/ncsc-x.x.x/bmi/cli/bmif_cli.py --regfile ./fe_output/regfiles/nplsim_physical_regsfile.yml

Packet Test:
============
Default packet generation script included with the program does following:
   Input : Send an IP packet to port-0.
   Output: On Behavior Model console, source & destination IP addresses of packet are printed.

To run the test, open terminal and browse to 'bus' program directory.
Run the following packet generation script included with the program.
   :> python bm_tests/corp_net/testPkt.py
